The benefits of deploying your React App this way are that you can automate your build and deployment tasks and by distributing your app across CloudFront you’ll be able to provision a free SSL certificate on it, which is great!</p> <h4>Prerequisites</h4> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com">Github Account</a></li> <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com">AWS Account</a></li> <li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html">AWS CLI</a></li> <li><a href="https://circleci.com">CircleCI Account</a></li> <li>Basic Knowledge of React, Git and the Command Line</li> </ul> <h4>Getting Started</h4> <p>First of all, let’s scaffold an app using <strong>create-react-app.</strong></p> <pre>#<strong>bash </strong></pre> <pre>$ create-react-app myawesomeapp</pre> <pre>[...]</pre> <pre>Success! Created myawesomapp at /your/path/myawesomapp<br>Inside that directory, you can run several commands:</pre> <pre>yarn start<br>    Starts the development server.</pre> <pre>yarn build<br>    Bundles the app into static files for production.</pre> <pre>yarn test<br>    Starts the test runner.</pre> <pre>yarn eject<br>    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files<br>    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!</pre> <pre>We suggest that you begin by typing:</pre> <pre>cd myawesomapp<br>  yarn start</pre> <pre>Happy hacking!</pre> <p>Now, setup your repo on Github and push your code up.</p> <pre>#<strong>bash</strong> </pre> <pre>$ git add .<br>$ git commit -m 'first commit, scaffolds project with create-react-app'<br>$ git remote add origin <a href="https://yourrepo">https://yourrepo</a><br>$ git push -u origin master</pre> <p>Now you should have your initial project up on Github. From here we’ll checkout feature branches and merge them in as we complete them. You can use a project management tool like <a href="https://waffle.io">Waffle</a> or <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> if you like, it helps keep track of what needs to be done. Depending on the complexity of your project, you could also checkout a staging branch and merge your features into that, bit by bit, but for the purposes of this we’ll stick with merging into master. The process is identical though, it’ll just require a bit more configuration.</p> <pre>$ git checkout -b 1-setting-up-build-pipeline<br>$ git push origin 1-setting-up-build-pipeline</pre> <h4>Setting up AWS</h4> <p>Head over to AWS and go to the S3 dashboard. Here we’ll create a bucket and set it’s permissions to <strong>public.</strong></p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6yZDmRUQu6hImt0DdUbcCQ.png"><figcaption>s3 dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>Click <strong>Create bucket </strong>and call your bucket something useful, like the name of your app or the domain it’ll live on, if you’ve bought one. I called mine <strong>myawesomeapp.com. </strong>Now we’ll quickly configure the permissions of the bucket and set it to <strong>public</strong> so that it can be accessed and viewed on a browser, by the general public. Click the <strong>Permissions </strong>tab and then the <strong>Bucket Policy</strong> button, this will bring up an editor.</p> <p>AWS uses JSON policy files to manage permissions of buckets and other services, the example below allows the public to <strong>Read</strong> the contents of the S3 bucket.</p> <pre><strong>#JSON</strong></pre> <pre>{<br>    "Version": "2012-10-17",<br>    "Statement": [<br>        {<br>            "Sid": "AddPerm",<br>            "Effect": "Allow",<br>            "Principal": "*",<br>            "Action": "s3:GetObject",<br>            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::myawesomeapp.com/*"<br>        }<br>    ]<br>}</pre> <p>You might be tempted to change the date, <strong>but don’t</strong>. It’s taken from their <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html">docs</a> and is linked to a particular version, changing it may break/alter your permissions.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3McynE2yYkmkiihfBRKlqQ.png"><figcaption>Bucket Policy</figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, you’ll need to configure your S3 bucket to host static sites — this is literally just clicking a few buttons.</p> <p>Head over to the <strong>Properties </strong>tab and click the <strong>Static Website Hosting</strong> card. You’ll need to input the entry page, which in our case will be <strong>index.html</strong>, you can also create an error page, but we’ll leave that blank for now. Hit <strong>Save</strong> and we’re ready to go!</p> <p>Using AWS CLI, we’re gonna sync our project with our bucket. Make sure you’ve got your Access Keys setup, if not just type <strong>aws configure</strong> in your shell and enter them there. These can be found/generated in <strong>My Security Credentials.</strong></p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/572/1*_-UciD-POyZG00v7Eao8pQ.png"></figure><p>Before syncing, we’ll need to build our project for production. We’ll then sync the contents of the <strong>build </strong>folder with our S3 bucket and BAM we’re live.</p> <pre>#<strong>bash</strong></pre> <pre>$ yarn build<br>yarn run v1.3.2</pre> <pre>$ react-scripts build<br>Creating an optimized production build...<br>Compiled successfully.</pre> <pre>File sizes after gzip:</pre> <pre>35.65 KB  build/static/js/main.35d639b7.js<br>  299 B     build/static/css/main.c17080f1.css</pre> <pre>The project was built assuming it is hosted at the server root.<br>To override this, specify the homepage in your package.json.<br>For example, add this to build it for GitHub Pages:</pre> <pre>"homepage" : "<a href="http://myname.github.io/myapp">http://myname.github.io/myapp</a>",</pre> <pre>The build folder is ready to be deployed.<br>You may serve it with a static server:</pre> <pre>yarn global add serve<br>  serve -s build</pre> <pre>✨  Done in 7.49s.</pre> <pre>$ aws s3 sync build/ s3://myawesomeapp.com --delete</pre> <pre>upload: build/service-worker.js to s3://myawesomeapp.com/service-worker.js<br>upload: build/manifest.json to s3://myawesomeapp.com/manifest.json<br>upload: build/favicon.ico to s3://myawesomeapp.com/favicon.ico<br>upload: build/index.html to s3://myawesomeapp.com/index.html<br>upload: build/static/css/main.c17080f1.css.map to s3://myawesomeapp.com/static/css/main.c17080f1.css.map<br>upload: build/asset-manifest.json to s3://myawesomeapp.com/asset-manifest.json<br>upload: build/static/media/logo.5d5d9eef.svg to s3://myawesomeapp.com/static/media/logo.5d5d9eef.svg<br>upload: build/static/css/main.c17080f1.css to s3://myawesomeapp.com/static/css/main.c17080f1.css<br>upload: build/static/js/main.35d639b7.js to s3://myawesomeapp.com/static/js/main.35d639b7.js<br>upload: build/static/js/main.35d639b7.js.map to s3://myawesomeapp.com/static/js/main.35d639b7.js.map</pre> <p>Now head back to your S3 bucket, under the <strong>Static Website Hosting </strong>card and click the <strong>Endpoint </strong>URL. If all is good, you’ll see the React Welcome Page.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Wv6Dpt5fW_a0FsWPAUx1mw.png"></figure><p>Your app’s now on S3! We can somewhat automate this further by combining the commands. Add the following to your <strong>package.json</strong> under the <strong>scripts </strong>section.</p> <pre>#JSON</pre> <pre>{<br>  "name": "myawesomapp",<br>  "version": "0.1.0",<br>  "private": true,<br>  "dependencies": {<br>    "react": "^16.2.0",<br>    "react-dom": "^16.2.0",<br>    "react-scripts": "1.0.17"<br>  },<br>  "scripts": {<br>    "start": "react-scripts start",<br>    "build": "react-scripts build",<br>    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",<br>    "eject": "react-scripts eject",<br><strong>    "deploy": "yarn build &amp;&amp; aws s3 sync build/ s3://myawesomeapp.com --delete"</strong><br>  }<br>}</pre> <p>This runs <strong>yarn build </strong>and syncs the contents of your <strong>build/ </strong>folder with your S3 bucket.</p> <h4>CircleCI Setup</h4> <p>Firstly, add your project by clicking <strong>Setup Project </strong>on the CircleCI Dashboard.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YpJQR7ZHFgEw9J8DCjTgSA.png"></figure><p>Next you’ll want to make sure you have <strong>CircleCI 2.0 </strong>as opposed to 1.0, which is a bit older. As we’re creating a React Project, we want our container to be Preconfigured with <strong>Node.</strong></p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cQLc_HVkG4VOLvep7qR79Q.png"></figure><p>Follow the instructions laid out on the CircleCI Dashboard. Your <strong>config.yml </strong>file inside your <strong>.circleci </strong>folder, should look something like this.</p> <pre>#<strong>yaml </strong></pre> <pre># Javascript Node CircleCI 2.0 configuration file<br>#<br># Check <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-javascript/">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-javascript/</a> for more details<br>#<br>version: 2<br>jobs:<br>  build:<br>    docker:<br>      # specify the version you desire here<br>      - image: circleci/node:7.10</pre> <pre># Specify service dependencies here if necessary<br>      # CircleCI maintains a library of pre-built images<br>      # documented at <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/</a><br>      # - image: circleci/mongo:3.4.4</pre> <pre>working_directory: ~/repo</pre> <pre>steps:<br>      - checkout</pre> <pre># Download and cache dependencies<br>      - restore_cache:<br>          keys:<br>          - v1-dependencies-{{ checksum "package.json" }}<br>          # fallback to using the latest cache if no exact match is found<br>          - v1-dependencies-</pre> <pre>- run: yarn install</pre> <pre>- save_cache:<br>          paths:<br>            - node_modules<br>          key: v1-dependencies-{{ checksum "package.json" }}</pre> <pre># run tests!<br>      - run: yarn test<br>      - run: sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y python-dev<br>      - run: sudo curl -O <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py">https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py</a><br>      - run: sudo python get-pip.py<br>      - run: sudo pip install awscli --upgrade<br>      - run: aws --version<br>      - run: aws s3 ls<br>      - run: yarn run deploy</pre> <p>You’ll notice we’ve added a few extra things. We<strong> </strong>install python and download AWS CLI. After that we check installed by checking the version and list our S3 Buckets.</p> <p>Once this is done, head back to the CircleCI dashboard and hit <strong>Start Building. </strong>From here you can navigate to your Project Settings and save your <strong>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID </strong>and your <strong>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</strong>.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3O6sT23QOhTtFYQRXF1Kkg.png"></figure><p>Once this is done, push your changes up to github and open a pull request. On the first Pull Request CircleCI won’t register, so just hit merge.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nMbRQCyZrY97Pp1m4eowGw.png"></figure><p>You’re pretty much set now!</p> <p>Checkout another branch for your next feature and once your ready to open a pull-request you’ll notice CircleCI will run your tests and if all passes and you merge, it’ll deploy!</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gEOuegBScam8dW9k0s2xjA.png"></figure><p>Congrats! You’ve setup a React App with a build pipeline, hosted on AWS!</p> <h4>Deploying your App Through AWS CloudFront</h4> <p>Now you’ve got a build pipeline setup and synced to deploy with your AWS Bucket, which is great. But it’d be even better if you distributed that across a CDN and slapped a SSL certificate on it. Enter CloudFront…</p> <p>Navigate to CloudFront’s dashboard and hit <strong>Create Distribution.</strong></p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FLpxg0PniEPl8yZsPzYmKg.png"></figure><p>You’ll then be given two options, as we’re creating a Web App, you’ll need to select <strong>Web</strong>.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NZDSWTzbxUMUzP7ZV9xEtw.png"></figure><p>On the next screen, in the <strong>Origin Domain Name</strong> field, you’ll get a dropdown list. Choose the name of your <strong>S3 </strong>bucket. You’ll also want to change the <strong>Viewer Protocol Policy </strong>to <strong>Redirect HTTP to HTTPS. </strong>Lastly you’ll need to set the <strong>Default Root Object </strong>to <strong>index.html</strong> as that’s the entry page to our app.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2IUblcnhcdI8dnofm1aFeA.png"></figure><p>Once you’re done hit <strong>Create Distribution. </strong>This will take a short while to deploy, but once it’s complete head over to the Distribution URL and you should see your app, as well as an SSL certificate.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MxA6JwpLfc8zpwZF9ztCog.png"></figure><p>You’re done! If you own your own domain, and it’s hosted in AWS Route 53, you can create an Alias record to point to the Distribution URL.</p> <p>If you have any questions, or need a hand with anything, drop a comment and I’d be happy to help! <a href="https://github.com/jameshamann/myawesomeapp">Here’s a link to the example repo.</a></p> <p>As always, thanks for reading, hit 👏 if you like what you read and be sure to follow to keep up to date with future posts.</p> <img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=844a1b2c75c9" width="1" height="1"><hr> <p><a href="https://blog.cloudboost.io/react-with-circleci-aws-s3-and-aws-cloudfront-844a1b2c75c9">React with CircleCI, AWS S3 and AWS CloudFront</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cloudboost.io">CloudBoost</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p> </div> </div> </div> <a href="/medium_posts/medium_posts/React%20with%20CircleCI,%20AWS%20S3%20and%20AWS%20CloudFront/">Hello</a> <div class="row"> <div class="col s12 m6"> <div class="card large"> <div class="card-image waves-effect waves-block waves-light"> </div> <div class="card-content"> <span class="card-title activator grey-text text-darken-4">Net Neutrality<i class="material-icons right">more_vert</i></span> </div> <div class="card-reveal"> <span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">Net Neutrality<i class="material-icons right">close</i></span> <p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RjxuRN3rfg-hGYjvD75sIg.jpeg"></figure></p> <p>With America gearing up for a big vote on Net Neutrality I thought I’d do a repost, to emphasise how important it is and what it could mean for the UK.</p> <p>I’ve done a <a href="https://medium.com/@jameshamann/why-should-i-care-about-net-neutrality-2bf85ac98a69">previous post</a> covering this issue, but in a nutshell <strong>Net Neutrality promotes a free and open internet where all data, content and applications are treated equally, without discrimination.</strong> Essentially everything carrying on like it currently is.</p> <p>This image explains all you need to know about why Net Neutrality is important, <strong>because this is what it could turn out like.</strong></p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tw7wz3sngWM0XO3vAChBuA.jpeg"><figcaption>Net Neutrality</figcaption></figure><p>An ISP could prioritise traffic however they wish and charge you for the luxury of using different applications. Whereas now you’d pay a flat fee for internet access, ISPs could impose, as the image suggests, multiple packages for different websites. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out this is negative for everyone. It’s anti-competition, anti-freedom, anti-everything. There’s no benefit, except to those right at the top.</p> <h4>But this is in the US, so why should I care in the UK?</h4> <p>For now, we’re protected by EU Law, which ensures an open and competitive internet market. However, with Brexit looming and all the other issues surrounding it, you might worry that this particular law isn’t translated correctly on the repeal bill.</p> <p>To be fair, in the UK, we have a much more competitive broadband market, and it allows users to switch with ease. However, a lot of these providers also tend to offer a broadband and online tv deals — think Sky and BT, for example. These companies have incentive to prioritise their content over Netflix, Prime or any other streaming service.</p> <p>Virgin already offer <a href="http://store.virginmedia.com/virgin-media-mobile/flexible-plans/free-whatsapp-facebook-messenger.html"><strong>data-free messaging</strong></a>, to Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Twitter. Whilst this sounds amazing, it’s bad for everyone in the long term. It’s anti-competition and makes it very difficult for new startups, in a similar sector, break into the market and gain a user base. Why would a user want to try out a cool new product, if the alternative is free to use. It creates an unfair playing field, which leads to a stagnant market and less innovation.</p> <p>Whilst things are better here in the UK than the US, the fact remains it’s an issue to keep in mind, especially with Brexit on the horizon. If the vote passes and the bill is repealed in the US it might pressure other countries to revisit their own Open Internet laws.</p> <p>As always, thanks for reading, hit 👏 if you like what you read and be sure to follow to keep up to date with future posts.</p> <img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=61c6b0c4bd26" width="1" height="1"> </div> </div> </div> <a href="/medium_posts/medium_posts/Net%20Neutrality/">Hello</a> <div class="row"> <div class="col s12 m6"> <div class="card large"> <div class="card-image waves-effect waves-block waves-light"> </div> <div class="card-content"> <span class="card-title activator grey-text text-darken-4">Ethereum and Blockchain Technology<i class="material-icons right">more_vert</i></span> </div> <div class="card-reveal"> <span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">Ethereum and Blockchain Technology<i class="material-icons right">close</i></span> <p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BxHhpHFs4UxM0Yrp4jUq0g.jpeg"></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*Wd4iif2NDQTgcGPFiYKF_w.png"></figure></p> <p>After the crazy highs of Bitcoin recently and it’s high volatility, people are getting more interested in cryptocurrencies and how they work.</p> <h4>What is a Cryptocurrency?</h4> <p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin are all examples of Cryptocurrencies, they are all <strong>decentralized.</strong> This means no central bank or body regulates, monitors or owns them. They work on a <strong>peer to peer </strong>network, meaning users directly connect to each other and make transactions through the use of cryptography — making hacking or fraud virtually impossible. Once the transactions are verified by the network, they are added to a shared public ledger — <strong>the blockchain</strong>.</p> <h4>The Blockchain</h4> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oMBBUce4G2mXyEhmEGAxRQ.png"><figcaption>Blockchain Diagram</figcaption></figure><p>As the digram illustrates, a transaction is requested, the network of nodes (computers) is notified, at which point it validates the transaction request. Once verified, the transaction gets added to the public ledger — <strong>the blockchain. </strong>Essentially the blockchain is just a giant immutable data structure, with each event/transaction/contract getting added to the end of it. If you’re curious, you can view live transactions for Bitcoin being added to the blockchain <a href="https://blockchain.info/">here</a>.</p> <h4>Types of blockchain</h4> <p>There are a few different types of blockchain.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Public.</strong> Think Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, these are all <strong>public and fully-decentralised blockchains</strong>. It cuts out the middle man and allows you to transfer the value of something directly to the recipient, via a peer to peer connection. Every transaction is verified and then synced with every node (computer) associated with that blockchain.</li> <li> <strong>Private. </strong>As it suggests, these are completely private blockchains. Only one organisation verifies and writes to the blockchain and, in a sense, it’s the opposite of blockchain as it<strong> fully centralises the system</strong>. Whilst it doesn’t offer the same in uptime and security that Public blockchains offer, it still provides a good way for more traditional businesses who wish to keep control, to adopt the technology.</li> <li> <strong>Consortium. </strong>Essentially a hybrid between public and private blockchains.<strong> </strong>This allows a group of organisations to collectively control the blockchain, in a sense <strong>it’s partially decentralised</strong>. Each transaction is verified by the organisations and then added to the blockchain. This could be a way for central banks to collaborate together or even for organisational voting, like voting for the next Olympics host.</li> </ul> <p>Blockchains are similar in theory, but their approach to tasks can be slightly different. Bitcoin looks to work as a currency, where you can transfer value directly to the recipient without any middle man (bank). Ethereum, instead, offers a much more powerful solution that allows developers to create applications utilising Blockchain technology, through <strong>Smart Contracts </strong>and <strong>Solidity.</strong></p> <h4><strong>What is a Smart Contract?</strong></h4> <p>A smart contract is a program that is executed exactly the way it is set up to by their creators. A developer could write a program and deploy it, without fear of fraud, third party interference and benefit from 100% uptime. Keeping with the Bitcoin examples, a simple smart contract transfers the value from one user to another, if the necessary conditions are met. Here, we’re limited to currency though. <strong>This is where Etherum is different. </strong>It replaces Bitcoin’s somewhat restrictive scripting language with it’s own called <strong>Solidity</strong>, allowing developers to build and deploy applications with it.</p> <h4>What is Solidity?</h4> <p>Solidity is a <strong>contract-orientated, </strong>high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It’s statically typed, meaning that the type of variable is known at compile time, as opposed to run time. This has some benefits in that type errors are picked up earlier in the development cycle and it can lead to faster programs because the compiler can produce optimised machine code if it knows the variables earlier. Having looked through some code examples, visually, it looks closest to something resembling JavaScript — but it’s not.</p> <h4>What can I build?</h4> <p>Anything you like! The poster example apps are voting , blind crowdfunding and multi-signature wallets. Ethereum is still young and obviously some of the tech is still in Beta, but there seems to be a curiosity in building these new types of applications.</p> <h4>Conclusion</h4> <p>Blockchain technology seems to be gathering pace, mainly through Bitcoin, but as organisations learn it’s benefits and the power of the technology, it could become a new way to develop applications. It seems now is a good time to start experimenting with it and seeing what real-world applications it could have.</p> <p>As always, thanks for reading, hit 👏 if you like what you read and be sure to follow to keep up to date with future posts.</p> <img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=261d9342caf8" width="1" height="1"><hr> <p><a href="https://cryptocurrencyhub.io/ethereum-and-blockchain-technology-261d9342caf8">Ethereum and Blockchain Technology</a> was originally published in <a href="https://cryptocurrencyhub.io">Cryptocurrency Hub</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p> </div> </div> </div> <a href="/medium_posts/medium_posts/Ethereum%20and%20Blockchain%20Technology/">Hello</a> <div class="row"> <div class="col s12 m6"> <div class="card large"> <div class="card-image waves-effect waves-block waves-light"> </div> <div class="card-content"> <span class="card-title activator grey-text text-darken-4">Creating your own Jekyll Theme Gem<i class="material-icons right">more_vert</i></span> </div> <div class="card-reveal"> <span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">Creating your own Jekyll Theme Gem<i class="material-icons right">close</i></span> <p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lUObMZ6Qt7WmFBwxZVEhfg.jpeg"></figure></p> <p>After searching for a short while, I found I couldn’t quite find a Jekyll Theme that I liked.

Once you’ve edited your <strong>.gemspec </strong>file and made sure all the necessary files are included, use the build command to build the first version of your gem. Ruby Gems use <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> so your first push might not be your major release, so it defaults to version 0.1.0.</p> <p>Briefly, Semantic Versioning works by incrementing the numbers based on <strong>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH </strong>releases. <strong>MAJOR </strong>version<strong>, </strong>as the word suggests, is a major release where you make incompatible API changes. <strong>MINOR </strong>version is adding functionality in a backwards compatibility manner. <strong>PATCH</strong> version is for any bug fixes. It’s best practice to follow these guidelines when releasing/updating your gem, so keep that in mind during future development if you further tweak your theme.</p> <pre><strong># bash</strong></pre> <pre>$ gem build YOURTHEME.gemspec</pre> <pre>$ gem push YOURTHEME.gem</pre> <p>This is where you’ll need your login details you created earlier. Once filled in, head over to <a href="https://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> and search for your gem. It should appear in the list of results, go ahead and view the page to ensure all the details are correct. If you make a mistake, don’t worry you can pull it off using a simple command.</p> <pre><strong># bash </strong></pre> <pre>$ gem yank YOURTHEME</pre> <p>Congrats, you’ve just published a gem! You can also add your theme to various jekyll theme sites, most of them require you to fork the repo and open a pull request with a new post about your theme.</p> <p>As always, thanks for reading, hit 👏 if you like what you read and be sure to follow to keep up to date with future posts.</p> <img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1f8180a0e4b8" width="1" height="1"> </div> </div> </div> <a href="/medium_posts/medium_posts/Creating%20your%20own%20Jekyll%20Theme%20Gem/">Hello</a> <div class="row"> <div class="col s12 m6"> <div class="card large"> <div class="card-image waves-effect waves-block waves-light"> </div> <div class="card-content"> <span class="card-title activator grey-text text-darken-4">Cloud Computing Service Types<i class="material-icons right">more_vert</i></span> </div> <div class="card-reveal"> <span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">Cloud Computing Service Types<i class="material-icons right">close</i></span> <p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TklL7QYA-HiCjoK7_suS3w.jpeg"></figure></p> <p>These days most people refer to things being in <strong><em>The Cloud </em></strong>but what does this actually mean? A general, high-level definition is <strong><em>the delivery of hosted services over the internet.</em></strong> Email, calendars, todo lists, photos, pretty much everything fits into that description. Think Google Drive backing your photos up or iCloud backing your iPhone up, both of these keep your data in stored in the cloud. This makes it easy to access your stuff across all of your devices. There are, though, a few different levels to cloud computing.</p> <h4>SaaS (Software as a Service)</h4> <p>This is the outermost layer of the types, typically targeted at the end customer. The provider makes their application available through a web-browser, mobile app or dedicated desktop app, which is powered by cloud infrastructure. Lets use Google Sheets as an example here. The benefits provided to the consumer include the ability to create, edit and update spreadsheets from anywhere, with multiple users able to edit at one time.</p> <h4>PaaS (Platform as a Service)</h4> <p>This is the middle layer of our pyramid, typically used by developers. Here a developer can deploy their app, written in whatever language they’ve chosen, to a pre-configured cloud infrastructure. The developer doesn’t deal with the configuration of the servers, databases or operating systems. Instead they are able to deploy their app with ease and speed. Let’s use Heroku as an example here. The benefits provided to the developer is quick, easy deployment with minimal hassle. You can push a rails app live within minutes, it allows for rapid prototyping and gives developers the ability to deploy an app without needing to worry about things like server configuration.</p> <h4>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)</h4> <p>This is the final layer, where all the nuts and bolts lie. This level is typically used by sysadmins who would be charge of provisioning servers and deploying application builds. From here you’re able to completely configure everything, from operating systems and network settings. Lets use AWS’s EC2 instances as an example here. From the EC2 console when deploying a new instance you’re able to choose from a wide range of AMI images. When your instance is setup, you can SSH in and configure it in anyway you see fit. This gives the user huge levels of customisation and flexibility, which is important if you’re running apps that require very specific needs.</p> <p>The diagram below provides a visual representation of each level.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/983/1*BDzFTN81tMRz6xzaBWVZAw.png"></figure><p>Beyond this there are further abstractions like DaaS (Data/Desktop as a Service), STaaS (Storage as a Service) and SECaaS (Security as a Service). These are quite specific, focused in particular sectors and not as commonly known as the main three mentioned above.</p> <p>As always, thanks for reading, hit 👏 if you like what you read and be sure to follow to keep up to date with future posts.</p> <img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3da6998a7a11" width="1" height="1"> </div> </div> </div> <a href="/medium_posts/medium_posts/Cloud%20Computing%20Service%20Types/">Hello</a> <div class="row"> <div class="col s12 m6"> <div class="card large"> <div class="card-image waves-effect waves-block waves-light"> </div> <div class="card-content"> <span class="card-title activator grey-text text-darken-4">Rails 5 API, React, Bitbucket Pipelines and AWS Elastic Beanstalk — Part One<i class="material-icons right">more_vert</i></span> </div> <div class="card-reveal"> <span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">Rails 5 API, React, Bitbucket Pipelines and AWS Elastic Beanstalk — Part One<i class="material-icons right">close</i></span> <p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vNHKJnEg6gu9ajO-Ubw2xw.png"></figure></p> <p>In this post we’ll be setting up a new Rails JSON API app, with a React front end.

Click the <strong>Settings </strong>button and add both your <strong>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID </strong>and your <strong>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</strong> to the <strong>Environment Variables </strong>section on the Settings tab. This is available from the <strong>My Security Credentials </strong>dropdown on your AWS Console, when hovering over your username in the top right. If you haven’t, you should really setup an IAM user. You shouldn’t really be using your Root Account Access Keys — but that’s out of scope for this post, if you want to see how to setup an IAM user head <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/setting-up.html">here</a>.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*snZTl-vmwRQy775elMRiyA.png"><figcaption>Make sure to hit the “Secured” check box when adding your Environment Variables</figcaption></figure><p>Now we can setup our app to deploy to Elastic Beanstalk, on each successful build.</p> <p>Open up your <strong>bitbucket-pipelines.yml </strong>file and edit it to resemble the following.</p> <pre><strong># myapp/bitbucket-pipelines.yml</strong></pre> <pre># This is a sample build configuration for Ruby.<br># Check our guides at <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8r-5Mw">https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8r-5Mw</a> for more examples.<br># Only use spaces to indent your .yml configuration.<br># -----<br># You can specify a custom docker image from Docker Hub as your build environment.</pre> <pre>image: ruby:2.4.2<br>pipelines:<br>  default:<br>    - step:<br>        caches:<br>          - bundler<br>          - pip<br>        script:<br>          - apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y python-dev<br>          - curl -O <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py">https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py</a><br>          - python get-pip.py<br>          - pip install awsebcli --upgrade<br>          - pip install awscli --upgrade<br>          - bundle install --path vendor/bundle<br>          - bundle exec rake<br>          - aws --version<br>          - eb init My-Application -r eu-west-2 -p arn:aws:elasticbeanstalk:eu-west-2::platform/Puma with Ruby 2.4 running on 64bit Amazon Linux/2.5.0<br>          - eb deploy MyApplication-staging<br>        services:<br>          - postgres</pre> <pre>definitions:<br>  caches:<br>    bundler: vendor/bundle<br>    pip: ~/.cache/pip<br>  services:<br>    postgres:<br>      image: postgres<br>      environment:<br>        POSTGRES_DB: 'myapp_test'<br>        POSTGRES_USER: 'root'<br>        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'test_user_password'</pre> <p>Lets take this moment to breakdown what exactly our pipelines file is doing. Bitbucket builds your app in a docker container, so if you wanted you could choose any docker image that best suited your app. The image we’ve chosen is pre-configured only for ruby 2.4.2, therefore we have to install any other dependancies or packages we might need during the build process. We also load in another docker container for postgres, as our tests will require a database. In order for this to work correctly you’ll also have to edit your <strong>database.yml </strong>file with the following.</p> <pre># <strong>myapp/config/database.yml</strong></pre> <pre>[...]</pre> <pre>test:<br>  &lt;&lt;: *default<br>  database: myapp_test<br>  <strong>host: localhost</strong></pre> <pre>[...]</pre> <p>Looking at the file, we first create a cache for our gems and for our other pip packages so that when the build runs, it doesn’t have to continuously download these dependancies. Instead, it can use the ones saved in our cache folder. This dramatically speeds the build up, which is important as you only get 100 minutes free per month. Next, we’re installing python in order to install AWS CLI and EB CLI. After that, we run our tests using <strong>bundle exec rake</strong>, if all tests pass we deploy the app using the <strong>eb</strong> commands.</p> <h4>Elastic Beanstalk Setup</h4> <p>Next, you’ll need to create an application in AWS’s Elastic Beanstalk console and initialise Elastic Beanstalk within your repo. This is what the console would look like once an app’s created.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*e7y26prn7bWEEWoy8R61NA.png"><figcaption>AWS Elastic Beanstalk Console</figcaption></figure><p>You can either create an environment now in the console or via EB CLI, I chose to do one now in the console as I can setup the database all in one go, but feel free to leave the database for later if you like.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2DPiZjKAkrVzhSPWtXMJ9g.png"><figcaption>Creating a new Environment for your App</figcaption></figure><p>You can name your enviornment whatever you like, I’ve called mine staging as I aim to have a staging site and live site.

Good thing we can scaffold this up in rails. I still urge you to study what’s happening in each of the created files, so you at least get a grasp of how your app’s basic functions work.

It’s basically like sending a letter, but making sure you put it in an envelope and seal it up before firing it off. With search engines now favouring SSL sites over others, it’s a good way to boost your ranking and ensure you’re protected.</p> <h3><strong>What is SSL?</strong></h3> <p>SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is a protocol that ensures a secure connection between the client and server so that information can be sent and received securely. This works by encrypting the data using a key-pair, a private key only accessible on server and a public key accessible to everyone. The message is encrypted and sent to the sever, with the public key, if the public key matches the private key, the data is decrypted and processed by the server accordingly. You can tell if you’re SSL secure by the green padlock on your web browser, if it says something like “Secure Connection” you’re good. Also the URL prefix would be https://… as opposed to <a href="http://.">http://</a>…</p> <h3><strong>Setup</strong></h3> <p>Pretty much most service providers, like GoDaddy, NameCheap, RapidSSL etc… provide an easy process to buy a certificate. Once purchased, you’ll need to generate a CSR (certificate signing request), it doesn’t matter where this is done, <strong>it doesn’t need to be done on the same server that you wish to install the certificate on. </strong>There are two ways to do this, through the terminal using <strong>openssl</strong> or (if you’re on a Mac) through the <strong>KeyChain Access </strong>application.</p> <h4>Using the Terminal</h4> <pre>$ openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout <em>yourdomain</em>.key -out <em>yourdomain</em>.csr</pre> <p>This command will prompt you to go through a little creation wizard, as highlighted below.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SO1lGlR16Czhih7lkivydQ.png"><figcaption>openssl Wizard</figcaption></figure><p>You’ll be asked to enter a few details as well as choosing a password for the keypair. Once this is done, the .csr (certificate sigining request) and yourdomainname.key is generated in the directory that you ran the command. If you open up the .csr file in a text editor it should look something like this.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h0NCgfQ4oSpxQoXIH6SlWA.png"><figcaption>yourdomain.csr</figcaption></figure><p>When managing your SSL, you’ll be asked for the csr, copy and paste or upload (depending on service provider) the file. Once this is done, verification will be done to ensure you’re the domain owner as well. This is done through either shooting an email across or adding a TXT record with a key value to your DNS. Once verified you’re ready to go! Depending on where you’re installing your certificate there will be different file types.</p> <h4>File Types</h4> <h4>.pem</h4> <p>This is the most common format and can have other suffix’s, including <strong>.pem, .crt, .key </strong>and<strong> .cer. </strong>You’ll know it’s in a <strong>.pem</strong> format if the file is readable in a text editor and starts with<strong> — — — BEGIN CERTIFICATE — — —</strong> . These types of certificates are used with Apache, Nginx and similar servers.</p> <h4><strong>.der</strong></h4> <p>This is a binary form of the .pem certificate. It can have the suffix <strong>.der </strong>and <strong>.cer</strong> and is typically used on the Java platform.</p> <h4>.p7b/PKCS#7</h4> <p>These types of certificates are also readable in a text editor, they start with — <strong>— — BEGIN PCKS — — —</strong> and end with<strong> — — — END PCKS7 — — — . </strong>They can contain certificates or chain certificates but can’t contain the private key, which will need to be in a separate file. These are supported on platforms like Windows and Tomcat.</p> <h4>.pfx/PCKS#12</h4> <p>This type of certificate file stores the certificate, any additional certificates and the private key in one binary, encryptable file. This is typically used on Windows platforms.</p> <p>If you find yourself with the wrong format, for whatever reason, there is a way to convert them. For more information, head over <a href="https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-converter.html">here</a> and follow the simple instructions.</p> <h4>Using Keychain Access</h4> <p>Do a quick spotlight search for Keychain Access and open up the application, it’ll look something like this. You’ll then want to head to the menu and navigate to the option <strong>Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority…</strong></p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qmnevFsFkR-88gaKxiolng.png"><figcaption>Click “Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority…” from the dropdown menu</figcaption></figure><p>This will bring up the following <strong>Certificate Assistant</strong>, where you’ll be asked to enter a few details. Ensure you choose the option <strong>Save to disk.</strong></p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WCwWyIp0wLMb6RjM_mBRBw.png"><figcaption>Ensure you choose <strong>Saved to disk</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Once hitting <strong>Continue</strong>, you’ll be asked where you want to save your .csr file, after that your .csr will be generated. Your private key will be accessible in the <strong>keys</strong> section of the <strong>Keychain Access</strong> app. Depending on your service provider you can either upload the .csr file or open a text editor and paste the contents of the .csr file to start the process.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qH6lkp1owLuf6hvD1PHDuw.png"><figcaption>All done!</figcaption></figure><p>That’s it really, depending on your type of server and configuration installation of the certificate will vary, but it’s usually quite straightforward.</p> <h3>Free SSL Certificates</h3> <p>AWS, Heroku, Azure all provide free SSL certificates for certain services. For example on AWS if you deploy your content through a CloudFront distribution you can apply an SSL certificate to it, free of charge using the Certificate Manager in AWS. As well as that there’s another cool service called <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"><strong>Let’s Encrypt</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p> <h4><strong>Lets Encrypt</strong></h4> <p>This service offers a free, automated and open certificate authority. It works by running a certificate management agent on your web server. They automatically renew the certificate before it expires, which is handy and stops you having to monitor the process. Another awesome reason to use this service is that they’re supporting wildcard certificates from January next year.

I chose Firebase as I’ve messed around with it before and remember it being a pretty good fit for mobile apps, plus the interface is pretty slick.</p> <p>I’m gonna assume you all have an app skeleton setup using either react-native init or create-react-native-app.</p> <h3>React-Native Project Setup</h3> <p>As I used react-native init, the first thing I do is create an <em>App.js </em>file in the root, copy and paste the code from either index.ios.js or index.android.js and paste it in <em>App.js</em> so it looks something like this.</p> <pre>import React, { Component } from 'react';<br>import {<br>  AppRegistry,<br>  StyleSheet,<br>  Text,<br>  View<br>} from 'react-native';</pre> <pre>export default class myapp extends Component {<br>  render() {<br>    return (<br>      &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt;<br>        &lt;Text style={styles.welcome}&gt;<br>          Welcome to React Native!<br>        &lt;/Text&gt;<br>        &lt;Text style={styles.instructions}&gt;<br>          To get started, edit index.ios.js<br>        &lt;/Text&gt;<br>        &lt;Text style={styles.instructions}&gt;<br>          Press Cmd+R to reload,{'\n'}<br>          Cmd+D or shake for dev menu<br>        &lt;/Text&gt;<br>      &lt;/View&gt;<br>    );<br>  }<br>}</pre> <pre>const styles = StyleSheet.create({<br>  container: {<br>    flex: 1,<br>    justifyContent: 'center',<br>    alignItems: 'center',<br>    backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF',<br>  },<br>  welcome: {<br>    fontSize: 20,<br>    textAlign: 'center',<br>    margin: 10,<br>  },<br>  instructions: {<br>    textAlign: 'center',<br>    color: '#333333',<br>    marginBottom: 5,<br>  },<br>});</pre> <pre>AppRegistry.registerComponent('myapp', () =&gt; myapp);</pre> <p>Next, in each of the <strong>index.android.js </strong>and <strong>index.ios.js</strong> add the following line:</p> <pre>import "./App";</pre> <p>This makes things a little easier in that you only have to worry about editing one file and changes will be reflected both in iOS and Android versions of the app. Obviously, depending on what you’re doing, some features may only be accessible on certain platforms/look different on either platform, so as the complexity of your app grows, you may find yourself editing each respective file on it’s own, but for the purpose of this, it works fine.</p> <p>I know there’s a few different ways to setup your file structure with a React Project, this is the way I’ve read/adopted for now, if you think it could be done better, please a shoot comment below!</p> <p>Delete anything style based out of the <em>App.js </em>file, we’ll create a specific stylesheet for each page as some styles would be specific to each page on the app. Next, create an ‘app’ folder in the root of the project and within that create a ‘component’ folder, this is where all our app pages will live as well as any components we create. Your project directory, if using react-native init, will look something like the below.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/586/1*gAU4-tIpgGUbNLNRDKjPKA.png"><figcaption>Project Directory for React-Native App</figcaption></figure><h3>Firebase Setup</h3> <p>Head over to <a href="https://firebase.google.com">firebase</a> and sign in (sign up, if you haven’t already, with your gmail account). You can then Add a project and enter the name of your app, as well as choosing the country/region you’re currently in. Once this is done you’ll be taken to your app’s dashboard screen, which looks something like this.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*R-8UGmPHIIOIFkb6hP5YIQ.png"></figure><p>You’re going to want to click “Add Firebase to your web app”, which will bring up a pop up with your config details.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*onAeLMrvhg3U5aXXiQ0v0g.png"></figure><p>This is obviously built for a web app so we’ll need to convert into pure JS to work with React-Native. We’ll then initialise the Firebase App in the <strong>componentWillMount() </strong>method, this ensures it’s called before the initial render of the component.</p> <p>It’s a good idea to use <a href="https://github.com/zetachang/react-native-dotenv">react-native-dotenv</a> so you’re not pushing your live api keys for the world to see. It’s super easy to setup, just create a <strong>.env </strong>file, add it to your <strong>.gitignore</strong> file, stick all your env vars in there and import them in where ever you need them.</p> <pre>import {<br>   FIREBASE_API_KEY,<br>   AUTH_DOMAIN,<br>   DATABASE_URL,<br>   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,<br>   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,<br>   MESSAGE_ID<br>} from 'react-native-dotenv';</pre> <pre>componentWillMount() {<br>        firebase.initializeApp({<br>            apiKey: FIREBASE_API_KEY,<br>            authDomain: AUTH_DOMAIN,<br>            databaseURL: DATABASE_URL,<br>            projectId: FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,<br>            storageBucket: FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,<br>            messagingSenderId: MESSAGE_ID<br>        });<br>    }</pre> <h3>Creating a Sign Up/Sign In form</h3> <p>We’ll extract our text input form into a separate component as we’ll re-use this for the input of an email, password, name or any other details we feel like capturing. In the ‘component’ folder, create a new file <strong>TextInputField.js </strong>and <strong>enter </strong>the below code.</p> <pre>import React, { Component } from 'react';<br>import { View, Text, TextInput } from 'react-native';</pre> <pre>import styles from './styles.js';</pre> <pre>const TextFieldInput = ({ label, value, onChangeText, placeholder, secureTextEntry }) =&gt; {</pre> <pre>const { inputStyle, labelStyle, containerStyle } = styles;</pre> <pre>return (<br>        &lt;View style={containerStyle}&gt;<br>            &lt;Text&gt;{label}&lt;/Text&gt;<br>            &lt;TextInput<br>                autoCorrect={false}<br>                placeholder={placeholder}<br>                secureTextEntry={secureTextEntry}<br>                value={value}<br>                onChangeText={onChangeText}<br>                style={inputStyle}<br>                underlineColorAndroid={'transparent'}<br>                autoCorrect={false}<br>            /&gt;<br>        &lt;/View&gt;<br>    );<br>};</pre> <pre>export default TextFieldInput;</pre> <p>Reason I highlighted <strong>enter</strong> was because you should really enter this stuff line by line, it’ll help you understand what you’re actually doing. It’s pretty straightforward, but let’s just break it down to see what we’re doing here.</p> <p>We’re importing everything we need, you’ll notice I’ve already setup some styles in a separate file, which we’ll go over in a sec. We start by creating a constant, <strong>TextFieldInput</strong>, which will take the arguments <strong>label, value, onChangeText, placeholder </strong>and <strong>secureTextEntry. </strong>Within our function we then define our <strong>styles</strong> constant, which allow us to define what styles to use and where to get them from. Next we setup a <strong>View</strong> using our <strong>containerStyle, </strong>and a <strong>TextInput, </strong>which will have a text heading value of whatever <strong>label</strong> is set to. We then define each of the <strong>TextInput </strong>parameters based on either the arguments we defined earlier. You’ll notice I’ve also added “<strong>underlineColorAndroid={‘transparent’}”</strong>. On Android you get this weird underline, which looks pretty messy, this line basically gets rid of it. Lastly, we export our new component, ready to be imported wherever we use it.</p> <p>Now we’re ready to create our Sign in/Sign up form, go ahead and create a <em>SignInForm </em>folder within our ‘app’ folder. Then create an <strong>index.js </strong>and <strong>styles.js </strong>Below is the completed snippet for our <strong>SignInForm </strong>page, let’s deconstruct it and see what each section is actually doing.</p> <pre>import React, { Component } from 'react’;<br>import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native’;<br>import firebase from 'firebase’;<br>import TextInputField from '../component’;<br>import styles from './styles.js’;</pre> <pre>class SignInForm extends Component {<br>    state = { email: '', password: '', error: '', loading: false };<br>    onSignInPress() {<br>        this.setState({ error: '', loading: true });</pre> <pre>const { email, password } = this.state;<br>        firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)<br>            .then(() =&gt; { this.setState({ error: '', loading: false }); })<br>            .catch(() =&gt; {<br>                firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)<br>                    .then(() =&gt; { this.setState({ error: '', loading: false }); })<br>                    .catch(() =&gt; {<br>                        this.setState({ error: 'Authentication failed.', loading: false });<br>                    });<br>            });<br>    }<br>    renderButtonOrLoading() {<br>        if (this.state.loading) {<br>            return &lt;View&gt;&lt;ActivityIndicator /&gt;&lt;/View&gt;<br>        }<br>        return &lt;Button onPress={this.onSignInPress.bind(this)} title="Log in" /&gt;;<br>    }<br>    render() {<br>        return (<br>            &lt;View&gt;<br>                    &lt;TextFieldInput<br>                        label='Email Address'<br>                        <a href="mailto:placeholder='youremailaddress@domain.com">placeholder='youremailaddress@domain.com</a>'<br>                        value={this.state.email}<br>                        onChangeText={email =&gt; this.setState({ email })}<br>                        autoCorrect={false}<br>                    /&gt;<br>                    &lt;TextFieldInput<br>                        label='Password'<br>                        autoCorrect={false}<br>                        placeholder='Your Password'<br>                        secureTextEntry<br>                        value={this.state.password}<br>                        onChangeText={password =&gt; this.setState({ password })}<br>                    /&gt;<br>                    &lt;Text style={styles.errorTextStyle}&gt;{this.state.error}&lt;/Text&gt;<br>                    {this.renderButtonOrLoading()}<br>            &lt;/View&gt;<br>        );<br>    }<br>}</pre> <pre>export default SignInForm;</pre> <p>Here we’re obviously just importing everything we need, notice that we bring in our <strong>TextFieldInput</strong> we made earlier as well as our <strong>styles</strong>, which we extract out to a separate file for cleaner code.</p> <pre>import React, { Component } from 'react’;<br>import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native’;<br>import firebase from 'firebase’;<br>import TextFieldInputField from '../component’;<br>import styles from './styles.js’;</pre> <p>Now we create our <strong>SignInForm</strong>. We start by setting the state of four variables, <strong>email, password, error </strong>and <strong>loading.</strong></p> <pre>class SignInForm extends Component {<br>    state = { email: '', password: '', error: '', loading: false };<br>    onSignInPress() {<br>        this.setState({ error: '', loading: true });</pre> <pre>const { email, password } = this.state;<br>        firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)<br>            .then(() =&gt; { this.setState({ error: '', loading: false }); })<br>            .catch(() =&gt; {<br>                <br>                firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)<br>                    .then(() =&gt; { this.setState({ error: '', loading: false }); })<br>                    .catch(() =&gt; {<br>                        this.setState({ error: 'Authentication failed.', loading: false });<br>                    });<br>            });<br>    }</pre> <p>Next we create a <strong>OnSignInPress</strong> function, we set the state of <strong>error</strong> to an empty string and <strong>loading </strong>to true. We then setup a constant, containing <strong>email </strong>and <strong>password</strong> and set those equal to <strong>this.state. </strong>This will capture the email and password values entered into the form. Next we call firebase’s <strong>signInWithEmailAndPassword </strong>method and pass it the arguments of <strong>email </strong>and <strong>password</strong>. Then, we call an error catcher which, if the Login was unsuccessful, i.e the user doesn’t exist, firebase’s <strong>createUserWithEmailAndPassword</strong> method will get called and passed with the <strong>email </strong>and <strong>password </strong>arguments. This will create a new user, which will pretty much instantly appear in your firebase console. Lastly, if everything fails, say you enter an email without a password, error is set to <strong>“Authentication Failed”</strong>, which is then displayed to the user. This is pretty much the meat of the authentication done. If you’re interested, head over <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.auth.Auth">to the docs</a>, there’s a bunch of other ways to authenticate, including phone number, next time I’ll go through social logins and all that other jazz.</p> <p>The next function <strong>renderButtonOrLoading()</strong>, as the title suggests, renders a button or a <strong>Loading </strong>message. Essentially we are rendering our <strong>loading </strong>variable from earlier, if it’s true it’ll display the text <strong>Loading… , </strong>we can obviously put a fancy animation in here as well, but I’ll leave that to you. We then render our Sign in button, which is bound to our function <strong>onSignInPress</strong>, so whenever the button is clicked, the function is run.</p> <pre>renderButtonOrLoading() {<br>        if (this.state.loading) {<br>            return &lt;Text&gt;Loading...&lt;/Text&gt;<br>        }<br>        return &lt;Button onPress={this.onSignInPress.bind(this)} title="Sign in" /&gt;;<br>    }</pre> <p>Lastly, we render the view. This is where we bring in our <strong>TextInputField </strong>component we made earlier. We enter the <strong>label </strong>value, <strong>placeholder </strong>text and set the state <strong>email </strong>variable equal to what’s inputted into the text field. Pretty much exactly the same goes for the Password field except of the extra option <strong>autoCorrect</strong> and <strong>SecureTextEntry, </strong>which as the name suggests, ensures the password is hidden from view with the •••••• or ****** characters. The final thing we do is export the whole thing, so we can call it in our <em>App.js </em>file.</p> <pre>render() {<br>        return (<br>            &lt;View&gt;<br>                    &lt;TextInputField<br>                        label=’Email Address'<br>                        <a href="mailto:placeholder='youremailaddress@domain.com">placeholder=’youremailaddress@domain.com</a>'<br>                        value={this.state.email}<br>                        onChangeText={email =&gt; this.setState({ email })}<br>                        autoCorrect={false}<br>                    /&gt;<br>                    &lt;TextInputField<br>                        label=’Password'<br>                        autoCorrect={false}<br>                        placeholder=’Your Password'<br>                        secureTextEntry<br>                        value={this.state.password}<br>                        onChangeText={password =&gt; this.setState({ password })}<br>                    /&gt;<br>                    &lt;Text style={styles.errorTextStyle}&gt;{this.state.error}&lt;/Text&gt;<br>                    {this.renderButtonOrLoading()}<br>            &lt;/View&gt;<br>        );<br>    }<br>}</pre> <pre>export default SignInForm;</pre> <p>This is the simple contents of our <strong>style.js </strong>file, within our <em>SignInForm </em>folder. It’s pretty self-explanatory.</p> <pre>'use strict';<br>import React, {<br>  StyleSheet<br>} from 'react-native';</pre> <pre>const styles = StyleSheet.create({</pre> <pre>errorTextStyle: {<br>        color: '#E64A19',<br>        alignSelf: 'center',<br>        paddingTop: 10,<br>        paddingBottom: 10<br>    }<br>});</pre> <pre>export default styles;</pre> <p>Whilst we’re doing stylesheets, here’s the one that sits within our <em>component </em>folder.

I’ll assume you’re set up on AWS, if not you’re going to need to create an account <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">here</a>.</p> <p>First you’re gonna head over the EC2 Dashboard, which should look a little something like this. You’ll notice I’ve chosen London as it’s the nearest region to where I am, make sure you choose the closest available region to you as well. One thing to note, however, is that the type of EC2 instances may vary between regions, so if my list looks slightly different from yours, that’ll be why.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*H0wZroUOzwG3pPPU_owzpQ.png"><figcaption>EC2 Dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>Obviously you’re going to want to hit “Launch Instance”, which will take you a list of available instances in your region. There’s a large variety to choose from, but for the purposes of this post we’ll choose<strong> Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS</strong>, which stands for Long Term Support and ensures there’s support for the server for at least 5 years.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*x-geXJ77MHaX0LY-7zU9aQ.png"><figcaption>EC2 Distributions</figcaption></figure><p>The next screen you’ll be faced with goes through the different instance types, we’ll want to make sure we pick the <strong>t2.micro </strong>as it’s part of the free tier. However, it’s worth knowing roughly what each instance class is best suited for. Obviously t2.mircos are for experimenting and playing around, anything in the M class is for general purpose web apps. Upwards from there, you’ll notice the C class, which is for compute intensive applications, the R class, which is memory optimised so think lots of RAM, X is bascially an X-treme version of R and both D and I represent storage optimised instances.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XeUwDpig6QGoRbF0aUynJQ.png"><figcaption>Types of EC2</figcaption></figure><p>Before reviewing and launching, we’ll need to set up a few extra things so click <strong>Configure Instance Details</strong>, which will bring you to this page.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4upHIZmoqdyTguqGFNiflg.png"><figcaption>Configuring your EC2</figcaption></figure><p>All of this can be left as is, but it’s important to at least understand what some of it represents. Obviously the top option allows you to choose the number of instances you want to launch.</p> <p>Spot Instances are actually kinda cool and basically allow you to bid on excess EC2 Computing Capacity at low demand times of the day. In a nut shell, you’ll set a bid price for the instance and as long as that bid price is greater than the spot price, you’ll be able to run instances. However, as soon as the spot instance price rises above your bid price, you loose your instances. This is great for applications where cost is a key factor and interruptions are ok.</p> <p>IAM Roles is a whole separate topic, which I’ll probably cover in a later post, we’ll leave it as is for now.</p> <p>The last section allows you to choose the shutdown behaviour, whether you want the instance to stop or be terminated straight away. The difference is that if you stop, you can still re-boot, however there’s no way back from termination. Thankfully, though, there’s also the ability to prevent accidental termination, which is pretty useful but probably not applicable for us right now. You are also able to enable CloudWatch monitoring and change the tenancy of your instance. This can be a cost effective solution if you know you’re going to need an instance for a set amount of time. It provides better rates than the normal EC2 tariff rates. Please note both these options come at an additional cost, so let’s just leave it as it is.</p> <p>The next section will allow you to add storage to your instance, again for the purposes of this we’ll be ok leaving it as it is, at the default 8GB.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_ivFgaSRmB3DlnU0MXENBA.png"><figcaption>Adding Storage to your Instance</figcaption></figure><p>Next up is Tags, a great way to keep your instances organised. They work in key value pairs and can help you quickly distinguish your instances apart, especially if you have the same application running in a staging and production environment.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*La43ygoVVEJOkZo_M9aPuw.png"><figcaption>Adding Tags to your Instance</figcaption></figure><p>Next you’ll be setting up a real simple security group for your instance which specifies what traffic can be allowed into your server.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*P_wuA9oSZV-paa3GZbNy4A.png"><figcaption>Creating/Configuring a Security Group</figcaption></figure><p>Obviously we’ll want to SSH in, so that’s an obvious one and we’d probably want to allow users to be able to visit the site over HTTP and HTTPS. I’ve also added PostgreSQL, if you’re going to connect to a separate database. You’ll notice the warning, which is absolutely fine, it’s just letting you know that all IP address are able to connect to your instance.</p> <p>After this is complete you’ll be ready to launch. You’ll be taken to a page which allows you to review your instance if you wish. Click “Launch” and you’ll be greeted with a pop up asking to either choose or create a key pair to access your instance securely. Lets create a new one for this instance by choosing the <strong>Create a new key pair </strong>option from the dropdown list.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g0sqMZTUdVf-WpmXTpzKDw.png"><figcaption>Generating a new Key Pair to securely access your Instance</figcaption></figure><p>Call it whatever you want and hit download, this will generate a key pair and download the .pem file for you. I have an SSH directory within my downloads folder, but as long as it’s accessible for you, that’s ok.</p> <p>Your instance will now take a minute or two to launch and warm up, in the mean time open up your terminal and navigate to the directory where your .pem file is located. In order to be able to SSH into your instance, you’re going to need to change the permissions on the file with the following command.</p> <pre>$ chmod 400 mykeypairname.pem</pre> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*csX33EgNFxcRhmQLofOLcw.png"></figure><p>Once your instance is all setup and ready your EC2 dashboard should look something like this.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Xc6mndmDyX1LAAIrL1uzdQ.png"><figcaption>EC2 Dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>Now we’re ready to connect to the instance.</p> <h4>Setting up on your Instance</h4> <p>First things first, you’re obviously going to need to SSH into your newly launched instance. Make sure you’re in the directory where your pem file is located and that you’ve changed the permissions on it as mentioned above.</p> <p>For Ubuntu instances the user is called “Ubuntu”, I believe it’s different depending on what distribution you use but I know Amazon uses ec2-user instead, so just make sure the user actually exists when trying to SSH in.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Z9Puh_slfXL-uXtfAp1Fuw.png"></figure><p>The command used to ssh in is simply:</p> <pre>$ ssh -i YourKeyPair.pem ubuntu@YourInstancePublicIP</pre> <p>Your instance’s public IP address can be found on the dashboard here:</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yu-BshsM_vGLJAwoX_VGfg.png"><figcaption>The far right column <strong>IPv4 Public IP </strong>is your instance’s public IP Address</figcaption></figure><p>You’ll be asked if you’re sure you want to connect, to which you’ll obviously reply yes. Once that’s done you’re in!</p> <p>A good thing to do first up is to get a quick update, however before doing this you’ll need to change to the root user, as the current user doesn’t have the required permissions.</p> <pre>$ sudo su //changes to root user<br>$ apt-get update //will run an update on the instance for you</pre> <p>Your instance is pretty much setup to go now, bear in mind though you’re starting from scratch so depending on your tech stack you’ll need to download everything from scratch from java to PostgreSQL to everything in between.</p> <pre>$ apt install postgresql <br>...<br>$ apt install default-jre-headless<br>... <br>//install everything you need for your application</pre> <p>That’s about it in a nutshell, obviously you’ll need to consider setting up your psql users etc… One thing I’ll mention is this setup assumes you’ll run your application and database on the same server, obviously this isn’t best practice and you should setup a separate database instance using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">AWS RDS</a> or on your own by launching another EC2 instance.</p> <p>Whilst quite a few of us use tools like <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Beanstalk</a> to take care of application deployment, it’s still useful to understand how everything works and how to set it up. One thing I’ll stress, though, is don’t overcomplicate if you don’t have to. Yeah I know, we’re getting into a different topic here about IAAS vs PAAS, which is a whole subject on it’s own. But, every application has it’s own requirements and both services suit different applications well, so choose whatever works and suits your application best.</p> <p>Thanks for reading, hit 💚 if you like what you read and be sure to follow to keep up to date with future posts.</p> <img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=78a166167a22" width="1" height="1"> </div> </div> </div> <a href="/medium_posts/medium_posts/Setting%20up%20an%20Ubuntu%20EC2%20instance/">Hello</a> <p style="text-align: center"><a class="waves-effect waves-light btn green darken-2" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@jameshamann/"><i class="material-icons right">library_books</i>Read more at Medium</a></p> </div> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/materialize.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/init.js"></script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </body> <footer class="page-footer"> <div class="footer-copyright" style="padding-left: 30px"> <i class="material-icons" style="padding-right:5px">copyright</i><p>2017 Copyright James Hamann | All rights reserved</p> </div> </footer> </html>
